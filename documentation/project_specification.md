# Project specification

The goal of the project is to implement two different lossless data compression algorithms (Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv), and to compare their performance. 

The program input is any file, and the output is a compressed file with a significant reduction in size. The compressed file can be decompressed back to the original.
